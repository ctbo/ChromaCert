This software provided under an MIT license. See the file LICENSE for details.

## Prerequisites

* Download and install the latest Python 3 from https://python.org (ChromaCert was developed using Python 3.11 under macOS)
* `pip3 install matplotlib numpy networkx pyqt5`

## Running the program

`python3 chromacert.py`

## (No) Documentation

This project is in a very early stage of development. Not all intended functions are implemented 
and there is no documentation yet. Most of the functionality is in context menus.
Try right clicking on graphs, row labels, operands, parentheses ... it is hopefully self-explanatory
(for someone who knows about chromatic polynomials of graphs).
Here's a screenshot:
